# Node.js-MySQL-Storefront

This application uses Node.js (with MySQL and Inquirer) to create an electronic storefront. It allows the user to purchase a specific quantity of products from a few different store categories. If there is a sufficient quantity of the requested product, the program allows the mock order to go through and updates the database accordingly. If not, it lets the user know that there are not enough units in stock.
